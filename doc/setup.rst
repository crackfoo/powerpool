Getting Setup
=============

PowerPool is a Python application designed to be run on Ubuntu Linux, but will
likely run in just about any Linux. If you're brave you might be able to get it
running on Window, but I wouldn't recommend it since it's untested and
unsupported.

Requirements
------------

* **Redis** - For share/block logging and hashrate recording
* **Coinserver** - PowerPool builds mining jobs by running ``getblocktemplate``
  or ``getauxblock`` on a Bitcoin Core, or bitcoin core like node. These docs
  will always refer to this as a "coinserver".
* **Miner** - To test out mining we recommend getting a cpuminer since it's
  easy to setup

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    mkvirtualenv pp  # if you've got virtualenvwrapper...
    # Install all of powerpools dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Install powerpool
    pip install -e .
    # Install the hashing algorithm modules
    pip install vtc_scrypt  # for scryptn support
    pip install drk_hash  # for x11 support
    pip install ltc_scrypt  # for scrypt support
    pip install redis  # for redis support

Now copy ``config.yml.example`` to ``config.yml``. Fill out all required fields
and you should be good to go for testing. 

.. code-block:: bash

    pp config.yml

And now your stratum server is (or should be...) running. Point a miner at it
on ``localhost:3333`` (or more specifically, ``stratum+tcp://localhost:3333``
and do some mining. View server health on the monitor port at
``http://localhost:3855``. Various events will recorded into Redis in a format
that SimpleCoin is familiar with. See `Simple Coin
<https://github.com/simplecrypto/simplecoin>`_ for a reference implementation
of a frontend that is compaitble with PowerPool.

Production Use
--------------

There's no guide at this point, but some general recommendations for new pool ops:

* Increase the number of connections on your coinserver with ``maxconnections``
  configuration parameter.
* Recompile your coinserver from source with an increased
  ``MAX_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS`` in ``net.cpp``. This will cause blocks that you
  solve to propogate to the network more rapidly.
* Change your ``stop-writes-on-bgsave-error`` configuration to ``no`` for Redis, in
  case you run out of disk space.
* Run PowerPool with ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2`` enviroment variable to skip all
  debugging computations/logging.
* Use a service like Nagios or Sensu to monitor your Stratum server ports with
  the ``check_stratum.py`` script in the contrib folder. Your miners appreicate
  good uptime.
* Use upstart or init.d to manage starting/stopping powerpool as a service.
  There is an example upstart config in the contrib folder.
* Use a firewall to block public access to your debugging port (``3855`` by
  default..), since it contains sensative information.
